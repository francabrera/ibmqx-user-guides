Now that we have a basic understanding of quantum properties and how to 
use the Quantum Composer, let's dive into the weird and wonderful world of the qubit! 
In this chapter, we will dig deeper into how we can use single qubit gates to 
manipulate quantum states, as well as the concepts of **superposition** and **phase.**

A **qubit** (short for **quantum bit**) is a quantum system consisting of 
two energy levels, labeled :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`|1\rangle`. 
The :math:`|0\rangle` state is often called the ground state because it 
is the lower of the two energies. Together, :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`|1\rangle` 
make up what we call“standard basis vectors”. Like all vectors, they point in a direction 
and have a magnitude. Defining basis vectors is a really useful trick we 
have borrowed from linear algebra. The basic idea is that once you have 
defined these vectors, you can construct any other vector from a linear 
combination of the basis vectors. 


Additionally, qubits also have a **phase**, which results from the fact
that superpositions can be complex. To represent these superpositions,
we put a coefficient such as a or b in front of the state like so:
:math:`a|0\rangle+ b|1\rangle`. Here’s what the formula is saying:
“The state is made up of a linear combination of :math:`|0\rangle` and
:math:`|1\rangle`, where the proportion of each depends on the
coefficients :math:`a` and :math:`b`.” The coefficients :math:`a` and :math:`b` could
be positive, negative, or even complex. If we take the absolute value
of :math:`a` or :math:`b` and square it (e.g. :math:`|a|^2` or :math:`|b|^2` ), we
get the probability of measuring the \ **0** or **1** outcome, respectively.
