The Bloch Sphere
=================

|

The basis states :math:`|0\rangle` and :math:`|1\rangle` and their linear
combinations :math:`a|0\rangle` + :math:`b|1\rangle` describe the state of
a single qubit. But because the coefficients a and b are not just real
numbers, but can be imaginary or even complex, visualizing a qubit
requires a special tool called the **Bloch Sphere.** 

The Bloch Sphere is a sphere with a radius of one and a point on its surface represents the
state of a qubit.  Like a globe uses longitude and latitude to describe
points on the surface, the Bloch sphere can also use angles to describe
the state of a qubit.  This representation allows any qubit state,
including those with complex coefficients, to be represented as a point
on the surface of the Bloch sphere.  Points on the surface of the Bloch
sphere which lie along the  X, Y, or Z axis correspond to special states
as described below.

The qubit state is shown by the orange line in the picture. In the
picture, the state at the top of the sphere represents :math:`|0\rangle`
and the state at the bottom of the sphere represents :math:`|1\rangle`. 
When the qubit is in a superposition of :math:`|0\rangle` and
:math:`|1\rangle`, the vector will point somewhere between the two on the
sphere (i.e. the angle :math:`\theta` angle becomes somewhere between 0
(pointing straight up) – and 180 degrees, or :math:`\pi` radians (pointing
straight down). Note that in radians, 1/4 of a turn is represented by
:math:`\pi/2`). 

We have another degree of freedom on the sphere: rotations around the Z
axis, which can be described by the angle :math:`\phi`. When :math:`\phi` is
non-zero, this indicates a change in the \ *phase*\  of the qubit. This
Bloch Sphere depiction works only for single-qubit representations. For
the purpose of the schematic, we’ll assume that the length of the Bloch
vector is equal to the radius of the Bloch sphere.
