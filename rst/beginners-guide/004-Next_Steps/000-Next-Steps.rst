- [Congratulate user on completing the Beginner's Guide]

- Next Steps: the Full User Guide
   - chapters 1-3 cover many of the same concepts as the Beginner's Guide, but with the mathematical background, as well as snippets of QASM code and examples from our QISKIT software developer kit.
   - That math and code background allows users to delve into Quantum Algorithms and Quantum Error Correction in chapters 4 and 5 of the Full Guide.

- This section contains:
   - If you'd like to continue your quantum learning, the next few sections cover topics that will help you  with the more advanced math and notation used in the Full User Guide
      - Dirac Notation
      - Introduction to Matrices
      - A brief overview of QASM, the quantum assembly language
      - as well as a list of additional resources that may be helpful 
   
- mention QISKIT? The "hello quantum section"?
