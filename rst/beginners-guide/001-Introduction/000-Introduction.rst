| We’re at the start of a new stage in the information revolution. The
  first stage began around 1950 with a handful of expensive room-sized
  computers, used only by specialists. Today there are more computers in
  the world than people, and we rely on them for everything from
  communication to transportation, commerce, and (of course!) the
  Internet. All of our computers’ varied abilities are produced by
  manipulating zeros and ones using simple operations like **AND**,
  **OR**, and **NOT**, which are called *logic gates*. By doing so
  billions of times per second in billions of places at once, they keep
  our world humming along in the manner to which we have become
  accustomed.

For over 35 years, IBM has been researching an utterly different kind
of information and information processing, as different from ordinary
“classical” information as a dream is from a book. Unlike dreams, this
new kind of information, called *quantum information*, is both
well-understood and useful. The basic unit of quantum information is
called a **qubit** (pronounced CUE-bit), and a machine for storing and
processing qubits is called a **quantum computer**. We’ve been
building and testing increasingly powerful quantum computers for
several years, housed at our Yorktown lab. Over the past two years we've made our 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers available over the Internet to the general public. In
other words, YOU now have a programmable quantum computer at your
fingertips!

Quantum theory, developed in the early 1900’s, revolutionized physics
and chemistry by successfully explaining the weird behavior of tiny
particles like atoms and electrons. In the late twentieth century it
was discovered that it applied not just to these particles, but to
information itself. This finding led to a revolution in the science and
technology of information processing, Potential applications for this new kind of computing include designing new materials and
drugs, searching databases faster, and solving systems of linear
equations with breathtaking efficiency.

By going through this Beginner’s Guide, we hope you will learn what’s
different about quantum computing, the fundamental quantum properties that quantum computing relies on, and how start experimenting with our quantum computers via IBM's `Quantum Composer <https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/editor>`_. **We anticipate that you will spend about 10-30 min on each section
(with the later sections requiring more time) as you read through this
guide and explore the sample quantum scores on the IBM Q Experience.**
