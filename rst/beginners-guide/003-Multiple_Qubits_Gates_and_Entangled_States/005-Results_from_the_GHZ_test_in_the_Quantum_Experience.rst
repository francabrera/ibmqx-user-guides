Results from the GHZ test in the Quantum Experience
===================================================

| Amazingly enough, we can test this ourselves in the Quantum Experience
  by creating a GHZ state, applying gates to the three qubits to put
  them in a state of superposition and entanglement, and performing the
  above combination of measurements. When we measure all three along the
  X basis, we get the equivalent of this “-1” condition compared to when
  we measure two of the qubits along the Y basis and the third along the
  X basis.

Our observation tells us that the system behaves as quantum mechanics
predicts, and not how our classical intuition would have predicted!

==========================  ============================
**Measurement (Q3/Q2/Q1)**  **States that are observed**
--------------------------  ----------------------------
YYX                         000, 011, 101, 110
YXY                         000, 011, 101, 110
XYY                         000, 011, 101, 110
XXX                         111, 100, 010, 001
==========================  ============================

Note once again: if we measure in the standard basis (along Z), we get
only 000 and 111 (with a 50-50 split!). The noise (small errors) in the
below table comes from experimental error due to the fact that we used a
real quantum processor, which is imperfect.

**We will soon be adding a section to this Beginner’s Guide about how to
implement a GHZ test yourself in the QX! So watch this space.**
