The Weird and Wonderful World of the Qubit
==========================================

In this section we will introduce you to the qubit. A qubit (pronounced
“cue-bit” and short for quantum bit) is the physical carrier of quantum
information; in other words, It is the quantum version of a bit, and
quantum computing revolves around it.
