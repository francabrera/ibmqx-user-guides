In this section we will introduce you to the qubit. A qubit (pronounced
“cue-bit” and short for quantum bit) is the physical carrier of quantum
information; in other words, It is the quantum version of a bit, and
quantum computing revolves around it.

By the end of this section you will have a basic understanding of

-  Qubits and their measurements
-  Excited states
-  Superpositions of qubit states
-  Single qubit phase 
-  The Bloch Sphere
-  Decoherence
