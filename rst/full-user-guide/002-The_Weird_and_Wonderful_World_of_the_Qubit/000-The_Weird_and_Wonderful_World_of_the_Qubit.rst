In this section we will introduce you to the qubit. A qubit (pronounced
“cue-bit” and short for quantum bit) is the physical carrier of quantum
information; in other words, It is the quantum version of a bit, and
quantum computing revolves around it.

By the end of this section you will have a basic understanding of

-  The Quantum Bit (Qubit)
-  Creating superpositions
-  Introducing qubit phase 
-  Advanced single qubit gates
-  The Bloch Sphere
-  Decoherence
