In this section we embark on more complex scores and explore the
components it takes to construct real quantum algorithms. We go beyond
simply defining entanglement and begin to use it in computation, in
order to perform some well-known algorithms (with more to come in the
future):

-  Grover's algorithm
-  Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
-  Learning parity with noise
-  Phase estimation algorithm
-  Shor's Algorithm
