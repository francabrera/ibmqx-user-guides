    What does “quantum” mean? 

Quantum theory, developed in the early 1900’s, revolutionized physics
and chemistry by successfully explaining the weird behavior of tiny
particles like atoms and electrons.  In the late twentieth century it
was discovered that it applied not just to these particles, but to
information itself. This led to a revolution in the science and
technology of information processing, making possible previously
unimagined kinds of computing and communication. 


::

    What is a quantum computer?

A quantum computer is a device able to manipulate delicate quantum
states in a controlled fashion, the way an ordinary computer manipulates
its bits. 


::

    What is a qubit?

A qubit is the quantum version of a bit, and its quantum state can take
values of \|0>, \|1>, or \ **both at once**, a phenomenon known
as \ **superposition**.  The half angle bracket notation \|>  is
conventionally used to distinguish qubits from ordinary bits. 


::

    What is a superposition? 

A superposition is a weighted sum or difference of two or more states;
for example, the state of the air when two or more musical tones are
sounding at once.  Ordinary, or “classical,” superpositions commonly
occur in everyday phenomena involving waves.


::

    How are quantum superpositions different?

Quantum theory predicts that a computer with N qubits can exist in a
superposition of all 2\ :sup:`N`\  of its distinct logical states
\|00...0> through  \|11…1>.  This is exponentially more than a classical
superposition. Playing N musical tones at once can only produce a
superposition of N states. 


::

    How is superposition different from probability?

A row of N coins, each of which might be heads or tails,
has  2\ :sup:`N`\  \ **possible**\ states, but it
actually \ **is**\  in only one of them—we just don’t know
which. For this reason, quantum superposition is a more powerful
resource than classical probabilism.

    How is a quantum superposition different from massive parallelism? 

Though superposition is stronger than a probabilism, it is weaker than
actually having an army of 2\ :sup:`N`\  real computers all working on
the problem at once. Superposition is strictly weaker than full
parallelism, and strictly stronger than probabilism.

    What is entanglement?

Entanglement is a property of most quantum superpositions and does not
occur in classical superpositions. In an entangled state, the whole
system is in a definite state, even though the parts are not. Observing
one of two entangled particles makes it behave randomly, but tells the
observer exactly how the other particle would act if a similar
observation were made on it. Because entanglement involves a correlation
between individually random behaviors of the two particles, it cannot be
used to send a message. Therefore, the term “instantaneous action at a
distance,” sometimes used to describe entanglement, is a misnomer. There
is no \ **action**, only \ **correlation**, which,
though uncannily perfect, can only be detected afterward when the two
observers compare notes. The ability of quantum computers to exist in
entangled states is responsible for much of their extra computing power,
as well as many other feats of quantum information processing that
cannot be performed, or even described, classically.

    What is a quantum gate? 

Quantum gates are the elementary building blocks for quantum
computation, acting on qubits the way classical logic gates act on bits,
one and two at a time, to change their state in a controllable way.
