<div class="line">We’re at the start of a new stage in the information revolution. The
first stage began around 1950 with a handful of expensive room-sized
computers, used only by specialists. Today there are more computers in
the world than people, and we rely on them for everything from
communication to transportation, commerce, and (of course!) the
Internet. All of our computers’ varied abilities are produced by
manipulating zeros and ones using simple operations like <strong>AND</strong>,
<strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong>, which are called <em>logic gates</em>. By doing so
billions of times per second in billions of places at once, they keep
our world humming along in the manner to which we have become
accustomed.</div>
<div class="line">For over 35 years, IBM has been researching an utterly different kind
of information and information processing, as different from ordinary
“classical” information as a dream is from a book. Unlike dreams, this
new kind of information, called <em>quantum information</em>, is both
well-understood and useful. The basic unit of quantum information is
called a <strong>qubit</strong> (pronounced CUE-bit), and a machine for storing and
processing qubits is called a <strong>quantum computer</strong>. We’ve been
building and testing increasingly powerful quantum computers for
several years, and last year we made a 5-qubit one, housed at our
Yorktown lab, available over the Internet to the general public. In
other words, YOU now have a programmable quantum computer at your
fingertips! We’ll soon be upgrading our public quantum computer, but
even five qubits are enough to get a feel for quantum computing.</div>
<div class="line">Quantum theory, developed in the early 1900’s, revolutionized physics
and chemistry by successfully explaining the weird behavior of tiny
particles like atoms and electrons. In the late twentieth century it
was discovered that it applied not just to these particles, but to
information itself. This led to a revolution in the science and
technology of information processing, opening the door to new types of
computing and communication.</div>
<div class="line">By going through this Beginner’s Guide, we hope you will learn what’s
different about quantum computing, and the new possibilities that it
opens up. Some of these might include designing new materials and
drugs, searching databases faster, and solving systems of linear
equations with breathtaking efficiency, in ways that are currently
impossible. To do all of this, quantum computers will use two
fundamental properties of the quantum world: <strong>superposition</strong> and
<strong>entanglement</strong>.</div>
<div class="line">So, what is <strong>superposition</strong>? Qubits can be in the “<span class="math">\(|0\rangle\)</span>”
state (called a zero-ket), the “<span class="math">\(|1\rangle\)</span>” state (called the
one-ket), or a linear combination of the two (superposition). The
half-angle bracket notation <span class="math">\(|\rangle\)</span> is conventionally used to
indicate qubits, as opposed to ordinary bits. When you measure the
<span class="math">\(|0\rangle\)</span> quantum state, you get a classical 0, and when you
measure the <span class="math">\(|1\rangle\)</span> quantum state, you get a classical 1. The
<span class="math">\(|0\rangle\)</span> state is sometimes called the ground state because in
many physical implementations of quantum computing, including ours, it
is the lowest energy state.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Now, for <strong>entanglement</strong>. Entanglement is a property of many quantum
superpositions and does not have a classical analog. In an entangled
state, the whole system can be described definitively, even though the
parts cannot. Observing one of two entangled qubits causes it to behave
randomly, but tells the observer exactly how the other qubit would act
if observed in a similar manner. Entanglement involves a correlation
between individually random behaviors of the two qubits, so it cannot be
used to send a message. Some people call it “instantaneous action at a
distance,” but this is a misnomer. There is no <strong>action,</strong> but rather
<strong>correlation</strong>; the correlation between the two qubits’ outcomes is
detected only after the two measurements when the observations are
compared. The ability of quantum computers to exist in entangled states
is responsible for much of their extra computing power, as well as many
other feats of quantum information processing that cannot be performed,
or even described, classically.</p>
